# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list despite successfully fetching data from an API.  The bug is caused by improper error handling and data processing.  The solution showcases how to properly handle loading and error states to provide a better user experience.

## Bug

The `DataList.js` file contains the buggy code.  It attempts to fetch data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint and display it using a FlatList. However, even when the API call is successful, the FlatList remains empty due to the way the data is processed and displayed.

## Solution

The `DataListSolution.js` file provides a solution that correctly handles loading and error states.  It ensures that the FlatList only renders when the data has been successfully fetched and processes the data correctly.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the app on your device or emulator.
4. Observe the behavior of the FlatList component.
